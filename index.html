      <h2>Products</h2>

      <p>I've written two books about Vue.js. They also discuss common design patterns, writing testable code, and share other insights I've learned over my years of working on complex web applications.</p>

      <h3>Design Patterns for Vue.js</h3>
      <p>
      I wrote an advanced book about Vue.js called <a href="https://lachlan-miller.me/design-patterns-for-vuejs">Design Patterns for Vue.js</a>. 
      There is a distinct lack of advanced content for Vue.js developers - I am looking to change that.
      </p>

      <h3>Vue.js Testing handbook</h3>
      <p>
      I authored a book about Testing Vue.js applications. It is viewed over 1M times year. It is probably the
      most popular resource on testing Vue.js applications.
      You can find it <a href="https://github.com/lmiller1990/vue-testing-handbook">here</a>.
